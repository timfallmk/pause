###Projects, Code Highights, and other Fun Stuff
Here's a (from from comprehensive) list of my recent projects, ones I've contributed to, and other things I like to play with:
#####Bees
*[`bees`](https://github.com/midonet/bees) is project to bring true open source and full featured SDN to containers and other distributed systems. It is designed to make all componenets distributed and leverages MidoNet[11] for the backend.*

>**Note**: This is part of a soon-to-be announced project in joint development with Docker [`libnetwork`](https://blog.docker.com/2015/04/docker-networking-takes-a-step-in-the-right-direction-2/)


>MidoNet for Docker Swarm, CoreOS Kubernetes, Konsole, and other cluster management tools
>
>[![Docker build](http://dockeri.co/image/timfallmk/bees)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/timfallmk/bees)

#####Arrakis
*[Arrakis](https://github.com/midonet/arrakis) is a collection of Puppet modules to deploy and configure MidoNet[11] as an option for networking in OpenStack. It is aligned with (and developed against) the upstream Puppet modules for deploying OpenStack on StackForge[9]. It's development also contributed code for making these default modules into a plugin framework capable of accepting multiple providers[10].*

#####Current Work
*Currently I am working on, and contributing to these projects. But who knows, this could change from minute to minute!*

* Docker Swarm
* CoreOS
	* `fleet` orchestration
	* `etcd` development and features
	* Networking
* Kubernetes
	* SDN
	* Plugin in frameworks for networking
* Docker Machine
