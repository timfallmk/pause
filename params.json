Created and trained system engineering team as well as oversaw product integration. Member of Professional Services team and evangelism/technical preview participation.\r\n\r\nCore focus on developing product integration, professional services and consulting, as well as evangelism and technical presentations. Developed several key projects (see [below](#skills) for details and examples) for integrating and deploying [MidoNet][11] into other systems. Oversaw open source community integration effort. Integration into a number of projects is currently under active development.\r\n\r\nLead and created [containerization][8] effort. Created spec for containerizing [MidoNet][11] in an OpenStack-based cloud environment, as well as developing first-class citizen SDN for Docker (and other container solutions). Fully containerized all [MidoNet][11] components, and designed distributed deployment and running systems to be used on modern distributed systems. Project will form the basis for native Docker networking and co-development with `libnetwork` (see [bees](#bees)).\r\n\r\nOther major responsibilites included core-development and debugging, customer-facing QA and support, and development of tech-talks designed to familiarize the community with SDN and the OpenStack ecosystem. These contributions required intimate familiarity with the technology and state of development for componenets like containers, Linux kernel development (networking componenets specifically), cloud orchestration, SDN developments, networking developments, etc.\r\n\r\n####**VP of IT and Infrastructure**\r\n#####Airtime Media Inc.  _2012 - 2013_\r\nFounding member of the operations/IT team for Airtime.com. Responsible for design and maintenance of internal systems and data platforms. Also established and implemented inventory tracking, remote operations, and scalability projects. Primary specialty in creating operations structures for companies just now needing them.\r\n\r\n####**Owner/Founder**\r\n#####SG-1 Technologies  _2004 - 2013_\r\nFounder and owner of data consulting firm specializing in deployment of computing systems and electronics as well as networks for small businesses. To date, SG-1 Technology Enterprises has seven active clients.\r\n\r\nCoordinated, designed, and managed all campus computer and networking systems for Menlo School in Atherton, CA. Expertise in Unix, Windows, and Mac architecture, including set up of wireless networks, centralized student account storage, universal portal access, and interactive student displays.\r\n\r\nConsultant to Menlo School in design of new campus “smart” classrooms and facilities. These classrooms incorporated multiple presentation systems to expand educational involvement. Redesigned network layout and developed new security measures allowing greater access and stricter monitoring.\r\n\r\nNetworking and website design for Roberts and Company Inc. Design of offsite networking conditions as well as front page and presentation management.\r\n\r\nSeven years experience in theatrical lighting design for plays and some cinema. This includes design and maintenance of high power electrical and control systems.\r\n\r\nDesign and implementation of home interconnectivity project for client of SG-1 Technologies. Provides for centralized, easy, electronic control of all home systems (entertainment, security, phone, etc.)\r\n\r\n#####*Biological Experience*\r\n*For information on biological experience and skills please see the [`tl;dr`][tl;dr] version*\r\n\r\n-------\r\n###Education\r\n* Menlo School, graduation 06/2005\r\n\t* G.P.A. 3.6\r\n\t* Six Advanced Placement courses, two honors courses\r\n\t* Technological Development Award and Scientific Advancement Award\r\n\t* National Merit Finalist\r\n* UCSC 2005-2007\r\n* Trinity College 2007-2009\r\n\t* Faculty Honors\r\n\t* Major: B.S.

It is designed to make all componenets distributed and leverages [MidoNet][11] for the backend.*\r\n\r\n>**Note**: This is part of a soon-to-be announced project in joint development with Docker [`libnetwork`](https://blog.docker.com/2015/04/docker-networking-takes-a-step-in-the-right-direction-2/)\r\n\r\n\r\n>MidoNet for Docker Swarm, CoreOS Kubernetes, Konsole, and other cluster management tools\r\n>\r\n>[![Docker build](http://dockeri.co/image/timfallmk/bees)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/timfallmk/bees)\r\n\r\n#####Arrakis\r\n*[Arrakis](https://github.com/midonet/arrakis) is a collection of Puppet modules to deploy and configure [MidoNet][11] as an option for networking in OpenStack. It is aligned with (and developed against) the upstream Puppet modules for deploying OpenStack on [StackForge][9]. It's development also contributed code for making these default modules into a plugin framework capable of accepting multiple [providers][10].*\r\n\r\n#####Current Work\r\n*Currently I am working on, and contributing to these projects.
